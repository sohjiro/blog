In this post we are going to talk distillery and how integrate with a project. And for this we are going to use the [phoenix framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org)

Please make sure that you have installed elixir and phoenix [installed](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation)

Ok, let's the show begin.

The first thing that we are going to do is create a `phoenix` project without `brunch` and `ecto`
